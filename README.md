# Doublets
Program that solves Lewis Carroll's game of doublets.
Given a pair of words, transforms the first into the second by making a chain of words between them in which one letter is changed from word to word. e.g. "hare hark hack sack sock"
User selects one of several data structures and one of several dictionaries with which to search for a chain. Not all word pairs produce valid chains. Breadth-first search implemented using queue. Depth-first search implemented using stack.
Written in Rose-Hulman's CSSE230: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis. Worked with Justin Eccles. Skeleton provided by Matt Boutell.
